/**
 * Lazily loaded reference that is not constructed until required. This class is
 * used to maintain a reference to an object that is expensive to create and
 * must be constructed once and once only. This reference behaves as though the
 * <code>final</code> keyword has been used (you cannot reset it once it has
 * been constructed). Object creation is guaranteed to be thread-safe and the
 * first thread that calls {@link #get()} will be the one that creates it.
 * <p>
 * Usage: clients need to implement the {@link #create()} method to return the
 * object this reference will hold.
 * <p>
 * For instance:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final LazyReference&lt;MyObject&gt; ref = new LazyReference() {
 *   protected MyObject create() throws Exception {
 *     // Do expensive object construction here
 *     return new MyObject();
 *   }
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then call {@link #get()} to get a reference to the referenced object:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MyObject myLazyLoadedObject = ref.get()
 * </pre>
 * 
 * NOTE: Interruption policy is that if you want to be cancellable while waiting
 * for another thread to create the value, instead of calling {@link #get()}
 * call {@link #getInterruptibly()}. However, If your {@link #create()} method
 * is interrupted and throws an {@link InterruptedException}, it is treated as
 * an application exception and will be the causal exception inside the runtime
 * {@link InitializationException} that {@link #get()} or
 * {@link #getInterruptibly()} throws and your {@link #create()} will not be
 * called again.
 * <p>
 * This class is NOT {@link Serializable}.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note. This class extends {@link WeakReference} as
 * {@link Reference} does not have a public constructor. WeakReference is
 * preferable as it does not have any members and therefore doesn't increase the
 * memory footprint. As we never pass a referent through to the super-class and
 * override {@link #get()}, the garbage collection semantics of WeakReference
 * are irrelevant. The referenced object will not become eligible for GC unless
 * the object holding the reference to this object is collectible.
 * 
 * @param T the type of the contained element.
