/**
 * Lazily loaded reference that is not constructed until required. This class is
 * used to maintain a reference to an object that is expensive to create, but
 * may need to be reset and recomputed at a later time. Object creation is
 * guaranteed to be thread-safe and the first thread that calls {@link #get()}
 * will be the one that creates it.
 * <p>
 * Usage: clients need to implement the {@link #create()} method to return the
 * object this reference will hold.
 * <p>
 * For instance:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final ResettableLazyReference&lt;MyObject&gt; ref = new ResettableLazyReference() {
 *   protected MyObject create() throws Exception {
 *     // Do expensive object construction here
 *     return new MyObject();
 *   }
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then call {@link #get()} to get a reference to the referenced object:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MyObject myLazyLoadedObject = ref.get()
 * </pre>
 * 
 * NOTE: Interruption policy is that if you want to be cancellable while waiting
 * for another thread to create the value, instead of calling {@link #get()}
 * call {@link #getInterruptibly()}. However, If your {@link #create()} method
 * is interrupted and throws an {@link InterruptedException}, it is treated as
 * an application exception and will be the causal exception inside the runtime
 * {@link InitializationException} that {@link #get()} or
 * {@link #getInterruptibly()} throws and your {@link #create()} will not be
 * called again.
 * 
 * @param T the type of the contained element.
